Assuming node and npm are functioning properly, clone the repo, then type npm install and npm start.  Should
be good to go.

All code below ./src is of original authorship, although not all of it was written fresh for this exercise. (Some
was brought in from previous projects.)

I know I didn't include much testing.  I started on this project on Saturday at 7:30pm, and JayneAnn indicated she
wanted the finished product today.  The test I did include uses some pretty sophisticated infrastructure including the
repository pattern which near seamlessly supplies the test repo instead of the http repo.

Thanks for your time.
